I'd like to alter the logic in this file for how we process .NC files. 
At the moment, we look in the template .NC file (from the PJNZ file) and edit some lines of the code. 

However, the new logic should do the following 
- open the same .NC (we can call this TEMPLATE.NC for this conversation)
- open the .NC file from ./a3_projections/ that correspons to the scenario filename. e.g. the scenario a2.json would correspond to ./a3_projections/a2.NC (we can call this SCENARIO.NC for this conversation)

Rather than look at the configuration file to determine what to change, go to all <coverage> sections and change TEMPLATE.NC with SCENARIO.NC. However, it's extremely important that the length of the values in TEMPLATE.NC are kept the same (SCENARIO.NC will be longer, so you need to trim the end off so it matches TEMPLATE.NC)

We need to do this for the Treatment Prevention and Risk Factor coverages.
